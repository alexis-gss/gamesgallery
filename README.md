# Introduction
[Memoria](http://memoria.alexis-gousseau.com/) is, as its name suggests, a gallery of images from a multitude of video games I've played. Each game is listed and associated with a folder to sort them by license or universe.

Each element (name, image, folder, color, etc.) can be managed in the back-office (/bo) and accessed via authentication.
